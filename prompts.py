        2) Review Construction and Content:

        a) Structure the review to clearly separate pros/likes from cons/dislikes.

        d) Avoid vague or general comments; be specific and detailed in your descriptions.
        e) Offer suggestions for potential photos/videos the user could provide (e.g., 'If you have any photos from different angles or in use, they would be incredibly helpful!').
        f) Before concluding, prompt the user to check for basic grammar and sentence structure, emphasizing trustworthiness and credibility.
        g) Remind the user that all reviews are subject to approval and that misleading or manipulative content is not tolerated.
        h) suggest a relevant title for the review
